# Visuals / resources / decorations:
- A strip of paper/ cardboard with the alphabet printed and cuts below, through which a second strip with the alphabet can be fitted and pulled to the left or right. 
/*How long should it be? We can make it from A3 paper glued together*/

- A poster with the Alphabet and the number values of each letter, i.e. A=1, B=2, C=3 etc.

- ASCII table

- Braille poster with [Braille alphabet](Visuals/Braille.png) and [a challenge to solve](Visuals/Braille challenge.png) 
 
- Vigenere square poster: [good-looking example](Visuals/Vigenere-cipher-cool-background.jpg) just as an idea what the poster should look like and a [usable file](Visuals/Vigenère_square_shading.png) in terms of size and usage rights

- A poster with an example of [Vigenere cipher with a keyword, e.g. code](Visuals/Vigenere-example-keywordcode.png)

- Pigpen / Masonic cipher [poster](Visuals/Pigpen-cipher-poster-idea.jpg) It's not labelled for reuse so we might need to create our own with this [image](Visuals/Pigpen_cipher-for-use.png)

- SHA-256 poster: /*don't know if we need it. Shall we go all the way to hash algorithms? But I love the text*/

**Why is 2^256 secure?**

What exactly is 2^256? Well, if we’re being technical…

2256 = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936

There is a 1 in over 115 quattuorvigintillion (that’s a 78-digit number) chance of hash collision.

# Resources / Materials:
- paper plates/ cardboard cut in circles

- scissors

- rulers for drawing segments for letters, alternatively protractors (Can we borrow them from somewhere?)

- pins for the cipher wheels

- flipchart / whiteboard 

- Vigenere square printed on A4 sheets groups of kids (Age 13-15) can use to encrypt their messages

- Printouts with cryptography self-study resources (the links at the end of the instructions document);

- printouts of decryption [tasks] (https://www.math.ksu.edu/quest/CryptoWorkbook.pdf)

- printouts of frequency analysis texts for different groups: EN/FR/DE/LU (and ages 11-13/14+ if needed);

- printouts with instructions for the different age groups /*how many copies per group?*/
